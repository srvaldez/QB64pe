This is the full fledged version of "The Simplebuffer System" library
by RhoSigma. The documentation and examples are part of the author's
"Libraries Collection" and can be found for download at the respective
forum thread here:
    https://qb64phoenix.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=23

Note: The sb_qb64_extension.bi/.bm files are not part of the buffer system.
      These files provide glue code for use of the buffers inside qb64pe.

Note also: Functions currently not used in qb64pe were commented out in
           order to avoid unnecessary bloat of the qb64pe executable.
